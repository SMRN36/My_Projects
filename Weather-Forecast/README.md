# Weather Forecast

It forecasts the current weather of the given countries and writes it on the image which we can download as image file and as well as pdf file.

First, I am fetching the weather data using the API. I have used OpenWeatherAPI to fetch the data (temperature and humidity) of the given countries. The requests and json library from python will fetch and format. 

After that the data is then drawn on the uploaded image using python pillow library and export it in an image and pdf format.
