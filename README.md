## Face Recognition System : 
It is the Supervised Machine Learning model built using OpenCv Python. At first, it detects whether the image has a face or not after that label that images then train the model to predict faces using LBPH algorithm (Local Binary Pattern Histogram).

## House Price Prediction Analysis:
Performed analysis on Boston housing data. Trained model with several algorithms to check which model gives less mean square error and cross validation score. Algorithms used are Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees and XGBoost. Among that the best model is XGBoost which has a Mean Square Error: 8.43 and CV score: 11.39. Converted that whole code to a website using streamlit library and deployed it in a cloud server.

## Movie Recommender System:
This system is based on the cosine similarity in Python.A content based recommender system. Fetching Movie data using API and performing the analysis. It is a streamlit python app where we are selecting any movie from the dropdown and the most similar movie will be displayed as a recommendation. Deployment has been done on a cloud server.

## Chatbot:
It is a virtual assistant which works on the voice command. It performs basic tasks such as searching something on web, google, stackoverflow, playing youtube videos, music playlist, fetching ip address, sending email and many more.

## Spam Detection System:
This detects whether the entered message is spam or not. Built using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. It is a streamlit app where basically we are entering a message in a text box and the model will detect and display whether that entered text is Spam or Not Spam.

## Weather Forecast:
It forecasts the current weather of the given countries using weather API  and writes it on the image which we can download as image file and as well as pdf file.

## Web Scraping:
Scraped the IMDB movie data from IMDB website using python requests and BeautifulSoup library and converted it into a CSV file.
